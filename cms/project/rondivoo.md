  ### Problem


  Some universities don’t have a platform for student organizations to engage
  with, manage, or promote events and members. Board members are usually
  burdened with the task of creating and maintaining a database if they keep
  track, to begin with.


  ### Objective


  Our objective for this project is to develop a mobile experience that helps
  organizations engage with, track, and manage members and events.

  ### Challenges


  Being the only designer onboard and not having any "real" experience, it was a
  challenge to obtain feedback on design-related decisions. I also had to step
  out of the realm of product design and lead branding such as co-creating a
  logo and creating a brand guide from scratch. But without challenges, there is
  no growth.

  ### Initial User Research Highlights


  To ensure our concept was necessary, we conducted a remote product discovery
  survey with 28+ board members from various student organizations at USC. We
  asked student leaders to identify issues when gathering organizational data,
  71% of participants said _tools are too expensive_; 57% _need multiple tools_
  to obtain analytics including Typeform, Webflow/ web builders, Instagram, etc.


  On the contrary, 51% of student leaders _don't know how to utilize their data_
  to create more effective events and 40% said they c_an't find important
  features_ on any of the tools they are currently using.

  Event tools are broad and wide-ranging. Anything from survey tools to CRMs and
  spreadsheets can be used to track and manage data related to student
  organizations. But only a few of them are free and easy to use. Of all tools,
  76% of student leader use Typeform or Google Forms and 73% use a spreadsheet.
  These tools are not mutually exclusive and are often used in combination with
  one another.

  Here's features student leaders identified that were missing in the current
  tools they are using. Lacking a centralized platform, 84% of student leaders
  are missing a source to display their events. This is important as an event
  post can capture data such as sign ups, shares, check-in, etc. 64% of student
  leaders are missing a ticket sale feature. Through a follow up question,
  student leaders often use mobile payment services like Paypal, Cash App, and
  Venmo to collect membership fees and ticket sales.

  tools to help us keep track of various club data," - Participant of product
  discovery survey


  ### Persona


  Ethan is a third-year psychology major at USC and President of the Psychology
  Club. This is Ethan’s first semester as President of any club so he wants to
  go BIG. With all the support around him, he believes it’s attainable. However,
  he is looking for new software to promote events and gain new interest.


  Up until now, the club has been primarily active on Facebook Groups.
  Everything is promoted through there. But being 20-years-old, Ethan is aware
  many people his age don’t use Facebook.


  He knows how tedious it can be to keep track of miscellaneous club data and
  wants to make life easier on his secretary and treasurer.

  ### User Flow


  Based on the findings from the product discovery survey, I thought it was
  necessary to add "Interests" to help users discover organizations based on the
  interests. I also proposed an organization specific walkthrough to teach
  student leaders on how to create events, showcase their club's personality,
  and discover analytics.

Included are styles like color, typography, and shadows. There is a separate document for the Rondivoo team with components ranging from search bars to badges and modals to segmented pickers.

  ### Next Steps


  Version 1.0 is still being developed as I write this but I'm already planning
  for V2.0 and bolstering our design system so that anyone can design the look
  and feel that is Rondivoo.


  The team at USC has entered us into an accelerator, so cheers to that.


  Although I've created a portfolio piece, my work here is not finished. It's
  only begun.  
    
  Wow... that was very corny.


  Have a great day!

  ### Learning Experience


  This is my first major project. Practically everything was new to me. Working
  with a team of developers and a marketer, designing a product that will
  actually see the light of day, everything.


  Having constant communication with the lead developer, I saw how much work
  goes into coding. I'm only a designer but I developed the work ethic of an
  engineer. I've learned how to leverage my skills to build a feature that can
  encompass five of them in one. I've learned that this line of work isn't about
  output. It's about the outcome and realizing that you made even the smallest
  of tasks just that much easier.


  Being the only "creative" onboard, I was faced with many duties that were out
  of the realm of UX/UI. But I had to overcome the worry of risking failure
  because I knew I had a team to support; a team that has supported me. I
  collaborated with a freelance illustrator to create Rondivoo's Kangaroo logo.
  I customized an existing font. I designed a 22-page brand guide. TWENTY-TWO
  pages! But I've never had more fun.


  Where there is no adversity, there is no growth.

### Introduction

Rondivoo is a social events app to discover events, organizations, and new connections. In addition, organizations are able to capture event and member data to promote to and grow their audience.  
  
As the founding Product Designer, I worked closely with the founding marketer on user research and the engineering team to design and deliver V1.0. I also led branding as I co-designed the Kangaroo logo and typeface as well as the brand guide. I have spend _3+ months researching and designing_. We will be testing the app with a four to 10 on-campus organizations at the University of Southern California (USC) in the Fall.
